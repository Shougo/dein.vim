## Features

- **Fast** - Faster than NeoBundle.
- **Simple** - Function API and familiar patterns, without commands or
  dependecy hell.
- **Async** - Clean asynchronous installation supported.
- **Extendable** - Supports plugins from local or remote sources, and also
  Non-Github plugins.
- **Consistent** - Go-like directory structure (eg.
  github.com/{_author_}/{_repository_})
- **Practical** - Automatically merge plugins directories to avoid long
  **runtimepath**


## Getting started


### Prerequisites

- **Vim** (v8.2 or higher) or **NeoVim** (v0.5.0 or higher)
- **Git** should be installed (v2.4.11 or higher)
- **xcopy** installed or **Python3** interface (on Windows)

**Note:** If you use **Vim** (lower than 8.2) or **NeoVim** (lower than 0.5),
please use **dein.vim** `v2.2` instead.


### Basic installation

To install dein.vim on **UNIX** systems, you should run the install script. To
do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the
following **wget** or **curl** command:


#### Wget

```sh
bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.sh)"
```


#### Curl

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.sh)"
```


#### Manual inspection

> **Note:** _"It's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you
> don't know."_

You can do that by downloading the install script, then looking through it to
check if the code is safe:

```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.sh
$ less installer.sh
$ bash installer.sh
```

The script code is well formated, so you can better understand all the code.
The script can take some arguments that are listed in **Additional Notes**
section below.


#### Additional Notes

- If you want to overwrite an existent `.vimrc` or `init.vim` config, pass the
  `--overwrite-config` (or in short `-oWC`) argument to the installation
  script. By default, if there's one config already, the new config is
  generated inside the base path.

- The `installer` script has prompt menus that helps you setup everything.
  However, if you want install **Dein.vim** into an different path location,
  pass the location to the end of the script like `bash installer.sh
  ~/.vim/bundle`.


### Powershell (Windows)

> The support for Windows requires Powershell.

Open your Powershell and download the script:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.ps1 -OutFile installer.ps1
```

After checking the code, allow it to be executed properly:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Lastly, for an installation at the `~/.cache/dein` directory execute:

```powershell
./installer.ps1 ~/.cache/dein
```


### Config example

<details>
  <summary>
    Show a UNIX installation example using <strong>"~/.cache/dein"</strong> as
    the base path location.
  </summary>

```vim
" Ward off unexpected things that your distro might have made, as
" well as sanely reset options when re-sourcing .vimrc
set nocompatible

" Set dein base path (required)
let s:dein_base = '~/.cache/dein/'

" Set dein source path (required)
let s:dein_src = '~/.cache/dein/repos/github.com/Shougo/dein.vim'

" Set dein runtime path (required)
set runtimepath+=s:dein_src

" Call dein initialization (required)
call dein#begin(s:dein_base)

call dein#add(s:dein_src)

" Your plugins go here:
"call dein#add('Shougo/neosnippet.vim')
"call dein#add('Shougo/neosnippet-snippets')

" Finish dein initialization (required)
call dein#end()

" Attempt to determine the type of a file based on its name and possibly its
" contents. Use this to allow intelligent auto-indenting for each filetype,
" and for plugins that are filetype specific.
if has('filetype')
  filetype indent plugin on
endif

" Enable syntax highlighting
if has('syntax')
  syntax on
endif

" Uncomment if you want to install not-installed plugins on startup.
"if dein#check_install()
" call dein#install()
"endif
```
